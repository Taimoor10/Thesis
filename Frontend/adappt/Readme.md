## Tools Required:
        i)   Node: v14.6.0,
        ii)  Expo: v3.22.3,
        iii) Expo Client: Install the application "Expo Client" from App store for iOS,
        iv)  npmPackages:
                 react: ~16.9.0 => 16.9.0 
                 react-native: https://github.com/expo/react-native/archive/sdk-36.0.0.tar.gz => 0.61.4,
        v)   react-native-cli: v2.0.1

## Steps for Installation and Configuration:

1. Node and Expo-CLI installation
   -  Run **setup** binary file provided in the project folder to install both `node v14.6.0` and `expo-cli v3.22.3`

   - See [docs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#macos) for node installation details
   - See [docs](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/) for expo-cli installation details

2. Expo client Installation
   - Go to App store on your iOS device and install **Expo Client** application
   
   - See [docs](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779) for more details about application
   
   **The Expo client application makes it possible to build and run application quickly on mobile device.Application cannot be started without expo client application**
  
  
## Steps:

1. Before Running the project. Replace the IP address provided in file "baseURL.json" in project folder with the IP address of 
      your own mac machine to allow application to send requests to the Node server. Keep the port number same. Save the file after
      modification.
   
   => Command: Type `ipconfig getifaddr en0` in terminal on mac machine to get IP address
               or
               Alernatively Go to "System Preferences -> Network" on mac machine to view IP address


   => Reason: The iOS does not allow port reversing, so the IP address of the machine has to be explicitly provided.
      Providing "localhost" as an IP address wont work.

   => baseURL.json file structure:
      {
         "baseUrl": "172.21.5.27:3000",    -> Replace 172.21.5.27 with the IP address of your machine. keep the port 3000
         "verifierUrl": "172.21.5.27:3001" -> Replace 172.21.5.27 with the IP address of your machine. keep the port 3001
      }

   /*Important: The structure in "baseURL.json" file allow application to send and receive information from the server. Do not 
                provide "localhost:3000" or "localhost:3001" as an IP address. provide IP address explicitly as "172.XX.X.XX:3000"
                and "172.XX.X.XX:3001". Save the file before running the project.


2. Run Expo:

   => Run binary file named "run" provided in project folder to launch expo. This will start a terminal. Keep the terminal running
   or
   Alternatively type the following command in terminal from project's root directory to launch expo. Keep the terminal running

    => Command: `expo start -c`

   Note: Expo Development Tool portal be will opened in browser on "http://localhost:19003/"

   See docs "https://docs.expo.io/workflow/how-expo-works/" for more details


3. The previous step will open Expo development tool in browser window. Select "Tunnel" from provided connections and Scan the
      QR code with camera of your iOS device. A prompt will appear on the device with message "Open in Expo". Tap on the option 
      to proceed. A javascript bundle will start building and application will be launched on device

    Keep the device active during this step

    Make sure, that the selected connection is Tunnel connection before scanning the QR code. On selecting a Tunnel
    connection a message "Tunnel ready" will be shown in the interpreter. If the message is not shown, stop the expo terminal and  
    perform step 2 again

    Possible Errors: Sometimes, the bundle gets corrupted during the bilding phase. This could result in error messages like
      "Could not connect to development server". Simply select "ReloadJS" as the option will be suggested on the bottom of mobile 
      device


## Functionality:

  Follow the instructions below in case of a certain issue or warning.
  
        1) In case of any error or warning as such "disconnected from the Metro server" in application during interaction, touch 3 
           fingers simultaneously on mobile screen or shake the device to open developer menu. Select "Reload" to restart the application.
        
        2) The credentials should be scanned in the heirarchy as they are provided. Scan the pre-requisite claim first to get the child credential.
           Smart contracts still maintain the state even if the credentials are deleted from the application.
           Smart contracts are usually one time deployment and are not required to be deployed again and again.
           However for demonstration purposes and application usage, if the smart contracts are deployed again. Delete the existing credentials.. 
           using "Reset" to reset the application. This also keeps the application consistent with the Node server.


### Menu Items:

   Press Enter button to get started with the application

   Credentials: The credentials screen shows all the claims scanned from the crdentials portal. It shows valid and expired
                tabs. However, Expired functionality is not yet implemented but is provided in the application to provide the
                future idea for Expired claims. 
                        
        1) Press on a credential to view details
        2) A Reset button is also provided in credentials page to delete credentials from the application.


   Press on the Menu icon on top left or slide finger on your iOS device from left to right to open application menu. 
         
         The menu consists of:

        1) Home: button to naviagte to Credentials screen
        
        2) Account: Provides the personal information. Press on any field to edit and then press Save to store changes.
                    /Note: The information provided in this page is required to acquire "Claim City" credential from credentials portal.
                        The credential is returned including the provided personal information.
            
        3) Scan QR Code: ScanQR codes provides multiple functionalities:
                        1) Scan Login QR to login into credentials portal
                        2) Scan Credentials QR code in credentials portal to acquire claims

        4) Setting: Page is under development and unimplemented yet

        5) Create Account: Provide unique usernames to create Ethereum Accounts
